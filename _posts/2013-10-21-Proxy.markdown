# Proxy 

# Intent

# Strucutre

# Four major variants

## Remote Proxy
Stands in for an object that lives in a different address space:
  
* another jvm
* another node on a distributed (networked) system
* &c


hides the fact that the subject doesn't exist in the local address space
* encapsulates the protocols necessary for communication between the address spaces  
    * hence, that communication is transparent to the client

## Virtual Proxy
allows one to delay the creation of expensibe objects until such time as they are really
needed (if ever). 

for example, using a proxy of an image in a page layout/desktop publishing application.

This allows the application to delay loading the decompressed image into memory.

## Protection proxy
Specifically oriented
