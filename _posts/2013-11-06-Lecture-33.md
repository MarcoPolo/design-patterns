Things for the final project:
    Sytanx Highlighting
    proportional fonts
    monospaced fonts (mixed)
    Auto tab align
    tab comments aligned
    something = 0; <tab> //comment
    something = 0 and other stuff ; <tab> 
    -> becomes
    something = 0; <tab>            // comment
    something = 0 and other stuff ; // comment


    line up variable names and values
    // look like 
    int    b1 = 3;
    double d1 = 4.5;


    << should be left pointing dounle angle qoutation mark

    //lookup font metrics


    a (subscript 2,3) === a[2][3]
    alpha = 7;
    (actual alpha) = 7

    Tab key is meant to setup programming blocks

# Command (233) Cont.
## A continuum of sophistication
The patterns allows for everything froma simple *Command* which binds a
speciific request to speicifc receiver - to very complex *Commands* which may
involve multiple requests and multiple receivers.

```
Simple
app.openUsingDialog();

Complex
name = dialog.selectFile();
file = new File( name );
doc = new Document( file );
app.addDocument( doc );
```

## Cool Super Powers

### Macros  
the pattern enables the creation of *composite commands* (aka Macros).  
* multiple *Command* objects are aggregated and treated as a single *Command*
* when executed is triggered, it will trigger each of the commands in sequence

## Support for multi-level undoable/redoable operations
See Object oriented Software Constructuion  2e Chapter 21, Section 3

## Deferred Execution
A Comand need not be executed imeediately; it can be queued for later execution

## Use in frameworkds
Enables one to implement a framework in which an actor triggers a generic
request  

* the developer building an application using the framework would implement a
  specific request as a command
* easy to add new Commands to the System.
