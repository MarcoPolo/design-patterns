# Template Method (325)

## Implementation (cont.)

### Modifiers * methods  
Q: Which access modifiers (in languages which support them) should be used with 
the TM an dthe operations it calls?
  
  
| modifier       |      method    |
| ---------------|---------------:|
| public/protect | concrete (when generaly useful, not TM specific) |
| protected      | hook           |
| abstract protected | primitive  |
| private final  | invariant steps (concrete methods that _are_ TM specifc) |
| ☨              | factory methods| 
| ☨☨             | TM             |

* ☨ - depends on whether
    a) there is a default implementation [whether abstract or not]
    b) who else should be able to use it [whether public or protected]


* ☨☨ - depends upon who is supposed to cal it


###  Some  things to ponder on your own 
Q1: Is an _inverted control strucutre_ an integral part of TM? Justify your answer.
    Could you use TM without _inverted control strucutre_

Q2: TM relies on _inheritance_. Would it be possible to get the same functionality using _object composition_?
If so, what would be some of the trade-offs? If not, why not? 

Q3: Isn't TM just plain ol' _procedural decomposition_ guised up for OOP?

# HW 3 (Magnitude) redux
Q: Could ` Magnitude ` have a data member + ` getMagnitude() ` ?
A: Not only can a ` getMagnitude() ` _not_ be defined in the base class ` Magnitude `,
 because there is no meaningful common type that all instances of magnitude can be reduced to
  
Q: What was meant by " `Magnitude` is not meant to define a type? "
A: instances of subclasses of `Magnitude` are _not_ substitutable for `Magnitude`

# Strategy (315)

## Intent
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangable.
 Strategy lets the algorithm var independently from the clients that use it.

## Example Applications  
* video compression
* encryption
* bitmap represntation
* data vidualization (tabular, char: bar, line, pie, ...)
* GUI component layout managers
* auto insurance quote  
    * states have different regulations & asess penalty points in different ways


## it's an alternative to _brute force_
    
    {% highlight java %}
        switch (whichAlgorithmToUse) {
            case alg1: alg1(data); break;
            case alg2: alg2(data); break;
        }
        ..

    {% endhighlight %}

## Facilitates code reuse
when algorithms are embedded in the client class's code, it makes it hard/impossible
to reuse the alogorithm's implemntation in a different context

Q1: Why not just lump all the algorithms together in a _utility class_ that could be 
shared by mutliple applications?

A1: (assuming we want to choose the algorithm at runtime) we'd need to make a choice,
thus requiring conditional logic

A2: All the alogorithms need to be present in memory, even if the application only uses one of them.

A3: Clients would need to be modified when new algorithms were added to 
the utility class ( in order to use the new algorithms )

A4: adding new algorithms would entail modifying the utility class: 
what happens when we don't have access to the source code?

## Structure
<uml here>


## Usage  
* The __Context__ (the Strategy's client) works with a __CStrategy__
    - _may_ use the same Strategy for the program's entire execution
    - _may_ use different Strategies as the program executes

* the __CStrategy__ may be set
    - a __mutator__ on the  _Context_ which allows one to choose the __CStrategy__
    - passed as a parameter to the _contextInterface()_
    - specified as a type parameter (when __Context__ is a generic/template/parametric class)

* anytime the client needs the results of the algorithm, it forwards the requet to __CStrategy__.

## Implementation
must choose between a push model or a pull model

## Push 
the client is responsible for passing data along with the request  
* con: must pass _all_ the information that _any_ member of the algorithm family might need,
 this is because we have to provide a single interface ` algorithmInterface() ` 
 that is usable with any __CStrategy__ (some may require information that other do not).
 Further, since we shouldn't make assumptions about which __CStrategy__ will handle
 the reqest, we can't safely pass _null_ values for things we think the algorithm will ignore


## Pull
the __CStrategy object__ requests the data it needsfrom the client    
  
* how does the Srategy know who the client is ( so it can make the request)?   
* pass a reference to the client when the __CStrategy__'s constructor is invoked    
    * Con: Strategy object can't be shared
    * Pro: makes for clean code
* con: tigher coupling between the client and __Strategy__
* the client _must_ support a known interface in order for a __Strategy__ to query 
  the client for the needed data

  
    

# HW02 [Java's sort() takes a comparator] redux
# TM?    
* The __Comparator__ is being used to customize in a (sort) algorithm.
* However Template Method uses _subclassing_ to redefine a template behavior

# Strategy?
* passing an object that implements an algorithm ( the __Comparator__) that is suitable
for comparing the actual typeof data in the collection.  
* however, Strategy relies on object composition

# Functor
A _functor_ in OOP, is an object that represnts a function; useful even with function pointers
because they contiain state

There are a lot of people who would argue that the use of __Comparator__ by `sort()` is an example of the __Strategy__
patter. However, I would argue that is really an
example of th euse of a functor, because it is being used to parameterize an _operation_ rather than an _object_

in the spirit of full disclosure that are some that believe thta functor...
"is a perfect realization the the Strategy pattern."

GoF talks about Functors in __Command__ pattern, but not in __Strategy__

# State (305)
## Intent
Allow an object to alter it's behavior when it's internal state changes.
The object will appear to change it's class.

## Applicability  
* use when an object's behavior is state-dependent - where the object's state is determined at runtime and may chnage
* use wen state-dependent behaviors may be implemented by multiple operations - i.e.,
 when an object changes state, the behavior of multiple ops may be afffected

{% highlight java %}
 class Order {
     OrderProcessor processor = ...;
     StateToken state = CREATED;

     submit() {
         switch ( state ) {
             CREATED:
                error( "Mustbe validated first.");
            VALIDATED:
                processor.submit( this );
                state = SUBMITTED;
            SUBMITTED:
                error( "Can't submit same order twice." )
            CANCELLED:
                error( "This order has been cancelled." )
         }
     }
     
     validate() {
         //also has state dependent behavior
         switch ( state )
             //...
     }
 }

{% endhighlight %}

-----

Note: there are multiple methods that have conditional logic used to determine _what_ to do depending on the Order's current state

In terms of the _specific implementation:_  

* Must execute decoding logic every time `submit()` is called
* Similar control structures exist in other methods
* _state transitions_ are embedded in those methods

From a code understanding & maintenance perpective:  

* Relatively hard to grasp the relationship between states because the transitions are buried in the code
* adding new states will be laborious and error prone because every method
containing the dcoding structures will need to be updated.
  


## Applicability (Cont.)
* use when the context has a limited, well-defined set of possible states
* the context must have well-defined transitions between states  
    - it's inappropriate to use the `State` when state changes are inconsistent or subjective


## Example: Translated to State pattern

The state pattern encapsulated state-dependent behavior in __separate__ _state objects_

{% highlight java %}

class Order {
   OrderProcessor processor = ...;
   StateToken state = CREATED;

   StateToken state = new CreatedState();

   submit (){
       state.submit();
   }
   

}

{% endhighlight %}

Note: don't get hung up on how state objects communcate with the context


There are several ways the can be implemented  
* in some langauges (e.g., java) have _nested classes_
* pass a reference to the 

{% highlight java %}
    class CreatedState extends State { 
        //or implements
        submit(){
            error( "Must be validated first" )
        }
    }
{% endhighlight %}
  
* nested class
* pass reference to the __State__ object when invoking its methods
* &c.

------- 

### observe: the control structure has been eliminated!  
* state transitions are _more_ explicit
    * no longer buried in the middle of a conditional block
* overall, easier to understand and maintain

### " The object will appear to change its class."
a __class__ defines the properties and behaviors of its instances; because the object's 
behavior may vary dramatically depending upon its state, that let the GoF to use
the phrase "wil appear to change it class." They are focuses on a _behavioral_ definition
of class rather than a _code_ definition of class. From the perspective of the defining 
code (and type system) the class doesn't change.

  
    

The distinction here is between:
* apparent class - what kind of think does this object _behave_ like?
* actual class - which class's constructor was used to instantiate ths object?

## Whatif a language allowed an object's actual class to to change
This would allow the use of combined __State-Context__ objects 
(remember in the canonical pattern, we're using different objects to change the 
Context's behavior) and thus there would be differnet State-Context classes, 
one for each state, and the object would migrate between them as its state changed.


## What kind of mechanisms could be used to implement this?
1> become (_insanceOfAnotherClass_)  
  
* first, we'd need  to instantiate _instanceOfAnotherClass_ and initialize it with _this_ object's current attrivutes.
* _instanceOfAnotherClass_) may have more or fewer attributes than the class from which we are transforming.
Thus we'll stipulate that the set of classes between which one can 
migrate must suppor the unoin of the attriutes _required_ by each of
the classes in the set.  

* Finally, point all references to the original object to instance of another class
* Smalltalk supports this

2> changeClassToThatOf(_AnotherClass_)
* we'll require that _ThisClass_ and _AnotherClass_ be drived from a common base class
[note: this was not a requirement of `becomes()` above]  
* the subclasses may not define additional instance variables  
* supported by a dialect of smalltalk (IBM's VisualWorks Smalltalk)

# Consequences of class mgiration?
It makes subclassing the `Context` more difficult

# HW 04
If you really could change class, would there be any reason to use the
State pattern? [200,500] words.
