# Administrivia  Read Adapter No class this friday

# Adapter (139)   ## Intent Convert the interface of a class into another
intercace that clients expect. Adpater lets classes work together that coudn't
otherwise becuse of incompatible interfaces.

## Varieties There are four

## Tailored adapters There is aan existing class that has the functionality we
need, but it lacks the required interface.

simple example: a linkedList won't (shouldn't) have operations name push(),
pop(), & poeek() but it will almost certainly have equivalent functionalities.

## Tailored Class adapterDefine a subclass of the exiting class (.e.g.,
LnkedList) that implemtns the desired interface (Stack) in terms of the existing
class's operations:

Note: some languages (e.g., C++)
support the notion of private (impomentation) inheritance

the type is not inherited, only the code is. In C++ all the operations become 
private in the subclass regardless of  their original access modifiers.
